To force the drone to land, run the following command:
rostopic pub /ardrone/land std_msgs/Empty

To reset the drone after it hit something, run the following command:
rostopic pub /ardrone/reset std_msgs/Empty

Need to make a "wait until within delta of altitude command"

The ARDRONE_ANIM_YAW_DANCE flight animation makes the drone look like it is shaking its head no.

ARDRONE_ANIM_PHI_DANCE is the boggyish one.

ARDRONE_ANIM_THETA_DANCE looks sort of like the drone is nodding yes, but lasts a bit too long.

Need to launch ardrone_autonomy with the following command to get proper tag detection (black and white oriented roundel on the bottom camera).

rosrun ardrone_autonomy ardrone_driver _detect_type:=12 _detections_select_v:=4
